<h1>Avante Garde and Experimental Film Gallery</h1>


The Avante Garde and Experimental Film Gallery is a reporisoty that constructs
data classes and functions to create an html film gallery site.

The site displays the name of the film, the description of the film,
the movie poster and the ciomplete film in an iframe.

The repository contains three files.

freshtomatoes.py:

A script which sets the html framework and determines the jquery injection
points for variables set in the data class definition of the movie object.

It contains the required Bootstrap and Jquery calls, the CSS for display and the
HTML skeleton of the page itself.  

The function open_movie_page() generates the page.

To customize the look and action of the page customizations will be made in
this file.

media.py:

This file contains the class definitions for the object Movie, sets the
requires values for the class and defines the show_trailer() function.

This function opens the webbrowser and displays the trailer or full
film from the YouTube link set within the constructed nistances of Movie() in
site.py.

site.py:

This script imports the freshtomatoes.py and media.py files and plays two roles.

The first role is to store the instances of the class Movie() that are created.

The second role is to take the instances of this class, store them as a list,
movies[], and call the function freshtomatoes.open_movies_page() with movies[]
as the variable.


<h3>Generating the Page</h3>

following:
```

```
If using a REPL or trying to load the program in Windows open the file site.py and select "Run Script".
